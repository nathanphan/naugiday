/prompts:speckit.specify Implement the full Ingredient Management feature set in Flutter (iOS, Material 3) as a cohesive flow. This includes all ingredient_management screens (1–4) and edit_ingredient_screen. Scope: (1) Ingredient List screen showing all ingredients with search, category/filter chips, empty/error states; (2) Ingredient Detail screen showing name, category, quantity/unit, freshness status, last updated, and actions (edit/delete); (3) Add Ingredient screen with validated form inputs (name, category, quantity, unit, freshness toggle/expiry date); (4) Bulk/Quick Manage screen to update quantities or mark multiple ingredients as used/bought; (5) Edit Ingredient screen reusing the add form with prefilled data. Use Material 3 components only (Scaffold, AppBar, Card, FilledButton, Assist/FilterChips, NavigationBar), Theme.of(context).colorScheme (no hardcoded colors), consistent spacing (8/12/16/24), and accessibility (VoiceOver labels, tap targets). Persist ingredients locally with offline support and restore state on restart. Include loading, empty, and error states for all screens, confirm destructive actions, and add basic analytics events for add/edit/delete. Keep code modular, testable, and production-ready. -- done

/prompts:speckit.specify Implement the full Scan feature UX for iOS in Flutter using Material 3, covering all scan_screen variants: normal_state, initializing_state, camera_unavailable, permission_denied, and disabled_state. In normal_state, support camera capture + gallery picker (complete the TODO) with clear primary CTAs, guidance text, and preview of the captured/selected image. In initializing_state, show a skeleton/loading UI while camera is preparing. In camera_unavailable, show a dedicated fallback UI with explanation and alternative path (gallery picker if allowed) + retry. In permission_denied, implement a first-class denied UI with steps to enable permission and a deep link to iOS Settings when possible; include a “Continue with gallery” fallback if applicable. In disabled_state, respect a feature flag/kill-switch to disable scanning and show a friendly explanation + alternative entry points (manual add ingredients / shopping list). Ensure robust error handling for capture/pick failures, large images (downsize/compress), and offline behavior (store locally and queue processing if needed). Use Material 3 components only (Scaffold, AppBar, Card, FilledButton/OutlinedButton, banners/snackbars), Theme.of(context).colorScheme (no hardcoded colors), consistent spacing (8/12/16/24), and accessibility (VoiceOver labels, tap targets). Add minimal analytics (scan_open, capture_photo, pick_gallery, permission_denied, open_settings, scan_retry, scan_disabled) and non-fatal error capture. Include widget + integration tests for permission denial flow, gallery picker flow, camera unavailable, and disabled-state toggling. Make sure that you look at folder design and look for all scan_screen folder. apply same UI -- in progress

/prompts:speckit.specify Implement the Shopping List feature (normal state) in Flutter for iOS using Material 3. Create a Shopping List screen that displays items grouped by category (e.g. Produce, Meat, Pantry), with check/uncheck to mark items as bought, quantity + unit display, and inline edit/remove actions. Support adding items manually and auto-adding from recipes or ingredients. Include loading, empty, and error states, confirm destructive actions, and persist all data locally with offline-first behavior and state restoration after restart. Use Material 3 components only (Scaffold, AppBar, Card/ListTile, FilledButton, Checkbox, AssistChips), Theme.of(context).colorScheme (no hardcoded colors), consistent spacing (8/12/16/24), and accessibility (VoiceOver labels, tap targets). Add basic analytics events (add_item, toggle_bought, remove_item) and ensure the feature respects existing feature flags and app-wide error handling.
