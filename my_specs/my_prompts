/prompts:speckit.specify Implement the full Ingredient Management feature set in Flutter (iOS, Material 3) as a cohesive flow. This includes all ingredient_management screens (1–4) and edit_ingredient_screen. Scope: (1) Ingredient List screen showing all ingredients with search, category/filter chips, empty/error states; (2) Ingredient Detail screen showing name, category, quantity/unit, freshness status, last updated, and actions (edit/delete); (3) Add Ingredient screen with validated form inputs (name, category, quantity, unit, freshness toggle/expiry date); (4) Bulk/Quick Manage screen to update quantities or mark multiple ingredients as used/bought; (5) Edit Ingredient screen reusing the add form with prefilled data. Use Material 3 components only (Scaffold, AppBar, Card, FilledButton, Assist/FilterChips, NavigationBar), Theme.of(context).colorScheme (no hardcoded colors), consistent spacing (8/12/16/24), and accessibility (VoiceOver labels, tap targets). Persist ingredients locally with offline support and restore state on restart. Include loading, empty, and error states for all screens, confirm destructive actions, and add basic analytics events for add/edit/delete. Keep code modular, testable, and production-ready.
